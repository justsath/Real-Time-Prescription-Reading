Extract the text data from the prescriptions and convert them into speech.

Problem Statement: Support elderly or vulnerable patients should be a focus for many businesses. This is especially true for those in the health care sector. Enabling voice messages can make it easier for elderly people to understand your message. Text-to-Speech can provide peace of mind by empowering you to give better services. For example, you could even send voice messages that read prescription labels. This can be a real challenge for anyone with reading difficulties, not to mention the elderly and visually impaired. A talking label, sent straight to your device, makes it easy to know everything about your medication. Dosage info can also be tracked and shared with caregivers.

Approach: You need to apply OCR techniques to extract the text data from the prescriptions and convert them into speech.
